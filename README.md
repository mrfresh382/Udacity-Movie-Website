# Udacity-Project4
This is a demonstration of using Python Classes displaying my favorite movies.
Notes: I modified the fresh_tomatoes.py file. The movie summary  appears when the cursor hovers over it below the movie poster using Javascript. I changed the class of the movie-tiles so that they would appear more cleanly. I changed the class of the movie-tile by adding this to the bootstrap configuration "col-md col-lg-3 col-xl-4."
